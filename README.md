# Simple-Linear-Regression-Advertising-Dataset


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales. Using a standard advertising dataset, the model predicts how different advertising channels impact sales performance, making it an ideal introduction to regression analysis for data science beginners.

## Dataset
The project uses the Advertising dataset which contains information about advertising budgets for different media (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the corresponding sales data.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: For numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms
- Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and analysis

## Project Structure
The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Reading the dataset
   - Understanding the data structure
   - Basic statistical analysis

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Exploring relationships between variables
   - Creating scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots
   - Identifying potential linear relationships

3. **Simple Linear Regression**
   - Implementation using Statsmodels
   - Implementation using Scikit-learn
   - Comparing the approaches

4. **Residual Analysis**
   - Checking model assumptions
   - Analyzing residual plots
   - Ensuring the model's validity

5. **Model Evaluation and Predictions**
   - Making predictions on the dataset
   - Evaluating performance using R-squared
   - Calculating Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

6. **Questions and Discussion**
   - Addressing common queries about linear regression
   - Explaining interpretation of coefficients
   - Discussing model limitations

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and all required libraries
3. Open the notebook `Advertising_Linear_Regression.ipynb`
4. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis

## Future Improvements
- Implement multiple linear regression
- Add cross-validation
- Explore feature engineering possibilities
- Try different regression techniques

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of simple linear regression concepts
- Practical experience with common data science libraries
- Skills in model evaluation and interpretation
- Exposure to residual analysis
